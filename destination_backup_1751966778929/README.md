## üöÄ Installation (Recommended: Global via npm)

```

After installation, you can use **any** of the following commands anywhere:

## üñ•Ô∏è Cross-Platform Alias Script (gmt)

To use `gmt` as a shortcut for `gitmat` on any OS, this project provides two scripts:

- `bin/gmt` (for Linux/macOS/Unix)
- `bin/gmt.cmd` (for Windows)

### **How to use:**

#### **On Linux/macOS/Unix:**

1. Copy `bin/gmt` to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):
   ```sh
   cp bin/gmt /usr/local/bin/gmt
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gmt
   ```
2. Now you can use `gmt` in any terminal.

#### **On Windows:**

1. Copy `bin/gmt.cmd` to a directory that is already in your PATH (e.g., `C:\Windows`).

   ```cmd
   copy bin\gmt.cmd C:\Windows\gmt.cmd
   ```

   Now you can use `gmt` in any Command Prompt or PowerShell.

2. **If you want to use a custom directory (e.g., your own tools folder or your project bin):**
   - For example, to use your project bin folder: `D:\current workings\gitMate\bin`
   - Add that folder to your system PATH:
     1. Open System Properties ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Environment Variables.
     2. Under "System variables", find `Path`, select it, and click "Edit".
     3. Click "New" and add the full path: `D:\current workings\gitMate\bin`
     4. Click OK to save. Restart your terminal.
   - Now you can use `gmt` in any Command Prompt or PowerShell, from any directory.
